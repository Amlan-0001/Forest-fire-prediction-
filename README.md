Forest Fire Prediction ðŸŒ²ðŸ”¥
ðŸ“Œ Objective
This project aims to predict the occurrence and severity of forest fires using machine learning models. It leverages the Algerian Forest Fire Dataset, which contains meteorological and environmental factors affecting fire spread.

ðŸ“Š Dataset
Algerian Forest Fires Dataset, which includes daily meteorological observations and Fire Weather Index (FWI) system components from two regions in Algeria: Bejaia and Sidi Bel-abbes. The data spans from June 2012 to September 2012 and is valuable for researchers working on forest fire forecasting and monitoring systems, particularly in Mediterranean climates.

Dataset Overview
Instances: 244 total (122 from each region)

Attributes: 13 features including meteorological data and FWI components

Target Variable: Binary classification indicating fire occurrence ("fire" or "not fire")

Attribute Information
Date: Recorded as day/month/year (e.g., 01/06/2012)

Temperature (Temp): Maximum temperature at noon in Celsius degrees (22 to 42Â°C)

Relative Humidity (RH): Percentage (21% to 90%)

Wind Speed (Ws): Measured in km/h (6 to 29 km/h)

Rain: Total rainfall in mm (0 to 16.8 mm)

Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC): Index from the FWI system (28.6 to 92.5)

Duff Moisture Code (DMC): Index from the FWI system (1.1 to 65.9)

Drought Code (DC): Index from the FWI system (7 to 220.4)

Initial Spread Index (ISI): Index from the FWI system (0 to 18.5)

Buildup Index (BUI): Index from the FWI system (1.1 to 68)

Fire Weather Index (FWI): Index (0 to 31.1)

Region: Geographical area of observation (Bejaia or Sidi Bel-abbes)

Class: Fire occurrence ("fire" or "not fire")
